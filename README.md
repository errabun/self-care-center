# Self Care Center
## Overview
How can I care for myself? One way is with affirmations and mantras!
Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth.
Mantras are repetitive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices. On [this page](file:///Users/ericrabun/turing/mod1-projects/self-care-center/index.html?message-type=affirmation) you'll be able to access an assortment of postive affirmations and mantras to maintain a positive state of mind!

Once on page, you'll find a prompt asking the user if they would like to receive a random affirmation or mantra to be displayed.  Once the user selects the which message they would like to receive, just click the receive message button to see a positive and encouraging message!

If you decide you don't like the affirmation or mantra that is displayed, you'll see a 'Delete this message' button appear below the 'Receive message' button that will delete the current message displayed from ever being displayed again!  We only want messages that speak to you, the user!


In the unlikely circumstance that you, the user, decides to delete all of the affirmations or mantras that are provided, the receive message button will not be displayed and my site will have failed to impart any positive self-empowerment.

## Future Additions

- We are working on being allowing the user to add their favorite mantras or affirmations to the database, so they can be accessed in future use.  
- Adding a 'favorite' button so you can star different mantras or affirmations that really speak to you!  We would add a each of your favorite messages to a list for you to be able to access anytime.


## Thank you for checking out my page!
 - I hope I was able to bring about some positive, self-empowerment to you day!
